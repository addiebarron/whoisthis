To-Do

* Trigger specific events on app transitions.
	- appOpened (at the end of opening animation)
	- appClosed (at the end of closing animation)
	- screenTo (forward)
	- screenBack (backward)
	- screenChange (triggered both forward and backward)
* Fix issue - if you call ScreenChange with an ID for a page in another app, you will be taken to an empty screen. E.g open mail, call ScreenTo('#messages').
- Style bottom and top bars
â€¢ Style all apps
- Notifications -- top bar?
