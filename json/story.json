You know you should be crying, but you want to ask questions instead. How long before a brain rots beyond salvageability? If we could clone neural networks within, say, a month, would any part of your father be intact? Should we be doing something other than embalming and burying him? You know in your very fingertips that there is no way to undo death – that thoughts of “if only I had” and “what if I hadn’t” are as useless as they are healthy. But what should you be doing now, you wonder? Your actions in the present are the only thing that can improve your life. </p> <p>A moment of recollection strikes you. It is painful, yet brief.

As if sensing the amount of iron in a metal bar could tell you anything interesting at all. As men, their mistake was thinking that the next frontier of sensation would have to do with the functional order of the external world, when a whole galaxy of unexplored feeling was inside them the whole time – embargoed by their fragile masculinity. You had always suspected the binary separating function from feeling was bullshit, and the empathy sensors finally proved it.</p> <p>Still, you couldn’t shake her doubts. Had the mod changed you? It was a puzzling question – you’d never been too sure of the “you” you stood for in the first place. Throughout your adolescence, from your earliest communications implant to your most recent course of hormone replacement therapy, “you” had always felt like an assemblage of whatever chemical and mechanical parts you had on hand, falling apart and recombining with the forward pulse of time.</p> <p>She had never agreed with that theory of Self. Some people get to feel like works in progress, she said; some people don’t, just by the circumstances of their birth. Your two families’ disparate geographies had made that decision for the both of you long before you were born.</p> <p>Things only got worse when your boss leaked the news of your surgery to the press. He was so proud of you, and she was furious. Didn’t you see now how he was using you? Didn’t you recognize the material advantage he stood to gain from an employee who could read feelings?

Pretty neat, right?</p> <p>We need this information by <b>7PM</b> tonight. So no rush, but yeah – a little bit of a rush!
